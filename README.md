### About Me
I'm Srishan KN, a final-year Data Science undergrad and Python developer passionate about building intelligent, scalable systems.

Deeply intrigued by the power AI and LLMs hold to shape the future of the tech industry, I focus on turning complex ideas into practical, high-impact solutions.
My interests lie in backend development, data pipelines, and Generative AI applications, bridging the gap between experimentation and production.

I enjoy exploring the complete AI development lifecycle: from designing efficient data workflows and training deep learning models, to integrating LLM-powered systems into real-world backends using LangChain and LangGraph.

Beyond AI, I love developing robust backend architectures with Django and FastAPI, and have a working understanding of React and Node.js for creating full-stack experiences.
I have a solid foundation in statistics, which helps me approach data-driven problems with analytical precision, and a beginner-level understanding of Docker for containerizing and deploying applications.
